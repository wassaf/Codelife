			DECCAN GLIDING ADVENTURE SPORT</h2>
		<div class="gli2">
		            <p style="color:#000; font:18px times new roman, sans-serif;"><b>Gliding is the ultimate adventure sport, a sport that requires the pilot to harness 
					the power of nature to stay airborne whether they’re flying locally to their club, flying long distances cross country
					or soaring at high altitude. Gliding in India is controlled by the DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation) and has been 
					mostly undertaken by IAF (Indian Air Force).<br> However in the current scenario gliding is increasingly brought into the public 
					domain and many aviation enthusiasts are being absorbed by this recreational sport. <br>
                   In the UK alone there are around 85+ gliding clubs with more than 8500 glider pilots soaring the skies. It is estimated 
				   that about 2500 gliders are registered in the UK, which are owned by clubs, institutions and some privately owned. 
				   In comparison, India has just 11 gliding clubs all of them in North India and operated by the state government and 
				   DGCA (of these some are now non-functional). In total there are only about 39 gliders in the whole of India. <br> 
                   Gliding is the most beautiful and absorbing way of flying. Even a first short flight can be a memorable experience,
				   and gliding's challenges and delights continue to enthral the most experienced pilots. No two flights are the same
				   with the pilot continually attempting to make the best possible use of the conditions on the day. Virtually anyone 
				   who is able to drive a car can learn to fly a glider. It may take from 50 to 150 flights before you go solo, 
				   depending on factors such as age, aptitude and how regularly you fly.<br> Apart from being reasonably fit, there 
				   are no great physical requirements and people with a variety of disabilities have found it possible to take up gliding. 
				   It is an advantage to start young although the minimum age for solo flying is 16, younger members can still learn before this age. 
				   There is no maximum age and many members have begun gliding after retirement and gone on to become successful solo pilots.
